# Core Blockchain Components Guide

## Overview

The core module provides essential abstractions and utilities for interacting with the Solana blockchain, managing wallets, handling transactions, and working with protocol-specific logic such as bonding curves and token operations.

## Key Components

### Solana Client

@src/core/client.py implements the `SolanaClient` class which:
- Handles RPC communication with Solana nodes
- Manages transaction submission and confirmation
- Provides methods for account data retrieval and subscription
- Implements retry logic and error handling for blockchain operations

```python
# Example usage
client = SolanaClient(rpc_endpoint, wss_endpoint)
await client.get_token_account_data(token_account)
```

### Wallet Management

@src/core/wallet.py provides wallet functionality:
- Secure private key handling
- Transaction signing
- Account derivation and management
- Integration with hardware wallets (where applicable)

### Public Key Management

@src/core/pubkeys.py contains:
- System address constants
- Program ID references
- Address derivation utilities
- Token account resolution functions

### Bonding Curve Mathematics

@src/core/curve.py offers:
- Mathematical models for bonding curve calculations
- Price impact estimation
- Liquidity modeling
- Swap pricing utilities

### Priority Fee Management

@src/core/priority_fee/manager.py implements:
- Dynamic priority fee calculation
- Fee cap enforcement
- Network congestion detection
- Transaction prioritization strategies

## Common Operations

| Operation | Key Functions |
|-----------|--------------|
| Send Transaction | `client.send_transaction(tx, opts)` |
| Get Account Data | `client.get_account_info(pubkey)` |
| Sign Message | `wallet.sign_message(message)` |
| Calculate Price | `curve.calculate_price_impact(amount)` |
