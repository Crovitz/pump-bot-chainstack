# Utility Functions Guide

## Overview

The utils module provides shared functionality and helper methods used throughout the pump-bot system. These utilities handle common concerns like logging.

## Core Utilities

### Logging

@src/utils/logger.py implements a centralized logging system:
- Consistent log formatting across the application
- Log level management
- File and console output handling
- Context-aware logging with component identification

```python
# Example usage
logger = get_logger(__name__)
logger.info("Processing token %s", token_mint)
```

## Common Patterns

| Operation | Utility |
|-----------|---------|
| Logging | `get_logger(__name__)` |

## Best Practices

1. **Reuse existing utilities** rather than implementing similar functionality
2. **Keep utilities focused** on a single responsibility
3. **Document usage examples** for each utility
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** when enhancing utilities
